# B field description 
# (Module: Particle Propagation)
#################################################

This module propagates charged and neutral particles from a given vertex centered in (0,0,0) to a cylinder 
defined by its radius and its half-length (oriented along the z-axis).
 
Radius of the magnetic field coverage: 2.25 m
Half-length of the magnetic field coverage: 2.5 m
Magnetic field: 2 T

# Tracker description 
# (Modules: TrackingEfficiency, MomentumSmearing)
#################################################

At this level Delphes gives the possibility to treat in a different way ChargedHadrons, Electrons and Muons 
which arrive from the Particle Propagation module.
The efficiency of particles detection and the momentum resolution are related only to the Drift Chamber; 
charged hadrons, electrons and muons are treated equally.

# EFFICIENCY: 
We introduce a dependence from the geometrical acceptance of the drift chamber (sensible until 260 mrad = 14°, 
corresponding to eta=2.1) and from the energy of the particles (asking for a minimum pT for electrons and muons 
to consent them to reach the chamber).
In the acceptance region (eta < 2.1):
E > 500 MeV        99.5%
300 < E < 500 MeV  65%
E < 300 MeV        6%

# MOMENTUM RESOLUTION: 
We introduce a different parametrization of the momentum resolution (as a function of the transverse momentum) 
for the barrel (until eta <= 0.87) and the endcap (0.87 < eta <= 2.1) regions. 
The parametrization is given by the formula: dpT/pT = sqrt (a^2 * pT^2 + b^2).
Barrel:   dpT/pT = sqrt (0.00034^2 * pt^2 + 0.00833^2)
Endcap:   dpT/pT = sqrt (0.0034^2 * pt^2 + 0.0833^2)

# Dual-Readout Calorimeter description 
# (Modules: ECAL, HCAL)
################################################

In order to implement the Dual-Readout calorimeter we choose to keep two different modules which have 
an identical geometric description and differ in the input collections and the energy resolution formula.
The geometry is given in Delphes as a segmentation of the cylinder in various cells (5.6 x 5.6 mm^2) in eta and phi directions, 
different for barrel (eta < 0.87) and endcap (0.87 < eta < 2.59, because the calorimeter covers the region until 150 mrad).
The resolution formula is given as a function of eta (barrel and encap) and energy: 
sigma = sqrt (a^2 * E^2 + b^2 * E) 

On one hand, we give Electrons, Muons and Stable Particles (from the Particle Propagator module) as input collections to ECAL,
merging before electrons and muons in a single TrackInputArray called tracks:
   set ParticleInputArray ParticlePropagator/stableParticles
   set TrackInputArray TrackMerger/tracks
	   	  
On the other hand, we give Charged Hadrons and Stable Particles as input collections to HCAL:
    set ParticleInputArray ParticlePropagator/stableParticles
    set TrackInputArray ChargedHadronMomentumSmearing/chargedHadrons

Electrons, photons and pi0 represent the electromagnetic component: all their energy is deposited in “ECAL”. 
K0(short) and Lambda deposit 100% of their energy in ECAL (HCAL) with a probability of 30% (70%): 
in fact they have 30% of probability to decay in two pions and then photons. 
The rest of particles deposit their energy in “HCAL”.
ECAL:  sigma = sqrt (0.02^2 * E^2 + 0.11^2 * E) 
HCAL: sigma = sqrt (0.01^2 * E^2 + 0.3^2 * E)

At the end of the Calorimeter Module, we merge the output (kept separately to simulate the DR Calo) in an unique one, 
using the Module EFlowTrackMerger.

# Efficiency reconstruction and Isolation

We describe in a similar way Photons, Electrons and Muons: a minimum pT of 0.5 GeV and a PTRatioMax of 0.12 (0.25) 
for Photons/Electrons (Muons); a minimum energy of 2 GeV; an efficiency of 99% equal for barrel and endcap.

It is needed to understand which types of algorithms we want to use.
We insert the simplest form in each module only in order to avoid external sources.

# TreeWriter
################################################

In the TreeWriter we save electrons and muons collection at different levels of the datacard flow,
in order to study the impact of the reconstruction efficiency for each step:

Electron1 = electrons from ParticlePropagator
Electron2 = electrons exiting from the Drift Chamber (Tracking Efficiency and Momentum Smearing)
Electron3 = electrons exiting from the calorimeter
Electron4 = electrons after final efficiency and isolation criteria

Muon1     = muons from ParticlePropagator 
Muon2     = muons exiting from the Drift Chamber (Tracking Efficiency and Momentum Smearing)
Muon3     = muons after final efficiency and isolation criteria
